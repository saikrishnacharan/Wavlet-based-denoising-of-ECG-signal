# Wavlet-based-denoising-of-ECG-signal
ECG (Electro cardiogram) signal consists of PR Segment, QRS Complex, ST Segment. During recording process, noise effect the signal heavily. Noise include baseline wandering, EMG noise, motion artifact, power line interference and electrode pop or contact noise. Our main goal is to denoise the ECG signal using wavelet denoising technique and make QRS complex more distinct and identify peaks and valleys of ECG  denoised signal.
